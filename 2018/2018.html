       <p>There was a modest boy, named Juan. Modest height, modest looks, modest interests, and overtly modest love life. He had jet black hair of medium length, freckles, and quite pale skin compared to his family. He'd never had a true relationship
       before, and in hindsight had never truly gone on a date before, at least not with a love interest. It was the beginnings of 2018, and it was mid March. His birthday has already passed, February 13th.
       He was 17 and had never loved before. One morning, Juan got up and slid out of bed. He sluggishly put on his shorts, long socks, and a t shirt, and a pair of checkered vans. Juan's low self esteem and self-consciousness led him to wear such basic
       and common outfits, a desperate attempt to fit in by someone who felt he belonged nowhere. Juan endured the long 25 minute drive to school and went through the day, texting in his groupchats and stopped to talk to some friends.
       </p>
       
       <p>Juan learned from some friends (who participated in an after school Christian fellowship called Younglife) that tonight's Younglife was a battle of the sexes, and they had to get as many boys to come that meeting so they'd win the battle.</p>
       
       <p>A couple of minutes had passed since school ended, when a friend approached him. <br> "Yo, Juan, come to Younglife tonight at Mr. Saad's! Band ended, right? So you shouldn't have any practice!" Juan's friend Joseph asked excitedly. 
       <br> And sure enough, the schedule was cleared for the day and his family was staying around the area, seeing as how Juan's mom had late work that day.
       <br>"Alright definitely" Juan blurt out, excited to have social interaction after long periods of isolation. "So who's taking us?"</p>

    <div class="row">
       <br>
       <p>They arrived, their friend Adam giving Juan and others a ride as they all hung out before the late 6 PM meeting. There were a lot of people outside, and when a new boy or group of boys showed up a loud, gargantuan, warrior like bellowing from
       all the boys who were excited to increase their numbers. When a girl or group of them arrived, they were met with an equally voluminous roar, but this time in a significantly higher pitch and more akin to an orchestra of out of tune piccolos.
       </p>
       
       <p>Dismissing the stigma pitting the men versus the women as the joke it was, Juan walked around and talked to some friends from school and otherwise who stopped by for that night's meeting. Among them, a tall, brown haired, and freckled young woman who Juan 
       had known since elementary school. Her name was Macyn, and Juan had business with her.</p>
       
       <p>Previously, as more of a joke than anything, Macyn had asked the boys in her groupchat to send pictures of themselves so her single Volleyball friends could rate them and see who wins. It was meant to be a silly joke, never really leading to anything.
       However, when the results came back (and it was even done a second time with new pictures to confirm the results) Macyn had seperately texted Juan about something. </p>
       
       <p>She texted him about one of the girls who may have been interested in a relationship, and how he was mentioned. Juan hadn't given it much thought, writing it off as a plan that would never come to fruition or wouldn't work because he was in the year above the girl.
       Eventually, after being shown pictures and seeing the girl when pointed out in school by mischeivous friends trying to catalyze a meeting between the two young individuals, he began to feel something new budding, but it wasn't anything too far out of the ordinary.</p>
       
       <p>Macyn started with a smirk, "Juan are you still interested in that relationship proposal?"<br>He had to think. He had to consider whether he was ready or whether he could do it.
       After what seemed to be an eternity of useless calculations and rationalizing that lead nowhere, a couple of seconds had passed before he offered his answer. </p>
       
       <p>"Yeah sure, I think so" Juan retaliated, feeling calm and oddly serene, but also excited and anxious on the inside, seeming to prefer gathering around the stomach area. Macyn, seemingly pleased with this response, proceeded to give Juan her number and the night went on without 
       further mention of the idea.</p>
       
       <p>Juan did not text her that night, or any other night, in fact, it was not until Macyn learned this and gave Juan an encouraging talk did he have the nerve to contact her for the first time. However, instead of text Juan decided to use Snapchat, a seemingly more impersonal means of
       communicating since she did not know him, nor did he know her and he was afraid of texting badly or out of line and ruining everything right off the bat. With Snapchat, it became more casual and calmed his nerves a bit. And that day, as soon as school ended and he was in the passengers' seat
       of his Grandpa's car, he decided to bite the bullet and do it. After all, the longer he waited the less time he had. He unlocked his phone, all the while sirens went off in his head and hihs stomach churned like a cotton candy machine. He went to the search bar and typed in her name: </p>

       <p>Nalani Emerson is a beautiful woman. Tall, with sleek toned legs and a similar muscle type all around as a result of years of Volleyball and other sports and physically demanding activities. Her long silky brown hair fell down her back for the most part, but she had threads coming down 
       her face. She had bright brown eyes, a short and round button nose, beautifully detailed and curved eyebrows, enunciated round cheeks and full lips comprising her face. Her skin was fair and light, and her sense of fashion was one of the most fascinating Juan would ever know, and would come to love to see every day at school.
       When Juan opened up a chat with her and began speaking, the two talked without a hitch and began to enjoy each other's sense of humor and company in seemingly one afternoon of talking. However, it felt to Juan like a wonderful never ending stream of thoughtfulness and caring he had never
       expected to receive, let alone so soon. And he didn't want it to end, but time went on and the two eventually called it a night.</p>
       <p>One day, Juan decided to ask Nalani out to a movie, a fairly safe and common first date. The two made accords, and met at their local movie theater later that night. It was a frigid night, windy and with temperatures lower than the Southern Californian desert natives were used to. After making
       his way inside, waiting with his heart pounding out of his chest from the pressure and anxiety, she followed a minute later and the two met face to face, alone, for the first time. At first, Juan felt intimidated by the fact she was as tall as him, and began to see darkness. However, one look into 
       her bright brown eyes showed him the light once again and the intimidation and fear subsided, seeing her height as more beauty to behold. The two awkwardly exhanged greetings and would occasionally glance over at each other shy eyed in the snack line, but not before Nalani's mom asked to talk to
       Juan on the phone. He kept it as formal as possible while Nalani was laughing at the one sided exchange she was listening to, and after all seemed well and the call ended, the pair bought a medium poporn and some candy and made their way into the movie. The movie, unimportant to Juan, played on
       as he would look over to admire the beauty of the young woman sitting alongside him. Both individuals, silly as it may seem, wanted to embrace each other's hand as a symbol, perhaps, or just because it would feel good. Nalani layed her hand palm up and fingers unfurled on her leg as a sign,
       but Juan, unsure of whether or not this was a sign to go ahead, waited and waited in order to not make a move she may not have agreed with. At this point, his stomach was in shambles and his body was in sensory overload. The loud action movie on his ears, the overwhelming beauty of the lady
       sat beside him, the taste of saliva gathering due to nerves, the magnificent smell of the young woman's hair and general self that emanated around her (a smell Juan would never forget), and now his fifth sense of touch was gonna be activated if they held hands? He could only picture himself bursting
       at the seams with all of this happening at once, but eventually after some quiet parts in the movie and some convincing of himself, he went for it and held her hand, which instantly washed over him a wave of relief and grace that he was not prepared for, like the high of a dangerously addictive drug.
       He felt the nerves leave his body, if only for a second, and they watched the rest of the movie in peace together. </p>
       
       <p>The next date was at her house, with her mother not home or aware of what was going on. The two climbed under her sheets and huddled together to watch a movie on Nalani's laptop. This one he remembered, a movie about a boy who meets a girl and they make plans to kill off classmates, a strange
       romance thriller drama flick. The day was beautiful, and the pair shared banter and layed on each other while watching the movie. After it ended, they got outside as it was almost time to go bbut wanted to go for a walk around Nalani's complex, admiring the spring grass and blue skies.</p>

        <h5>As I'm finising this I'm crying. Maybe it's the powerful music having an effect on me as I look back on all these memories and pictures, or maybe it's something else. Regardless, I know they're tears of happiness. You gave me a beautiful year, almost 8 months but regardless the year for me is defined 
        by you, and all the happiness you brought me during a time when I didn't think it was possible for my life to improve whatsoever. My family bought a new house, it's my senior year, I'm doing Y&G which I love, but still I can dedicate my year to no one besides the most deserving. I'm so happy and thankful you gave me those 8 months of your time and loved me dearly throughout. I may not have been the most mature or understanding boy you could ask for, but I want you to know 
        I was trying my best and despite the learning and the work I had to put in just as you did as well, it was always more than wortwhile to talk to you and have you by my side despite whatever stupid shit happened. I'll admit that I dropped the ball and caused turbulence, but those 8 months were unbelievable and
        easily one of the best time periods in my life thus far. I got comments from family and friends about my smiling when you'd text me or I'd see your face on snapchat, something that would otherwise never happen since I'm never smiling. You gave me a reason to smile! A reason to be happy! A reason to exist!
        And for that, I can never hope to repay the debt I am in to you. I say often that I don't see myself with a future, but for a solid 8 months I knew exactly what I wanted for the future. Who knows what the future stores for me, I lost that idea and now I'm back in the dark but nothing has made me happier than seeing you 
        happier around school and on social media lately.</h5>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Before I finish, I want to apologize for what I think is the most regrettable thing I ever did to you. One day, you texted me about your aspirations, excited and glad to share with the person who's supposed to love and support you through everything. I still cringe thinking back, at why I would do that and how I could do that to you. I put my own selfish thoughts and fears first and foremost because I didn't understand what the outcome would be if I didn't, and I was and in many ways still am immature. If I could take back what I said and instead say this, I would do anything for the chance: </h5>
        <p></p>
        <h5>"Nalani, I'm so proud of you. I'm so <i>fucking</i> proud and I don't tell you this often but you have so much potential that it makes me truly ecstatic to hear you talk about your future like this. I know you can do it, and I'll be here to support you the whole way. I love you"</h5>
