            <p class="text-center">During the process of the python project, I was missing for the beginning of the project. On the first Friday we began, I was home sick with a fever so I missed out on the first day. However, when I came on Sunday, 
            my partner had began with a concept and he had a barebones system of a bank working. It was glitchy, so I stepped in and fixed up many of the bugs with my partner. Furthermore, we had an error in our withdrawal and deposit functions that 
            crashed the system whenever someone would enter a string value because the input had to be interpreted as a float in order to do the banking calculations and to use cents after dollars. To fix this, I did some research and introduced a new 
            method we hadn’t learned, blocks called “try” and “except” that check for errors after running a line of code, and runs a special line of code if an error is encountered. This solved our crashing error, and from then on out I fixed the 
            withdraw and deposit functions and the program was working correctly. After that, my partner added some extra functions to the program to add extra accounts to transfer money between them, and our project was finished.</p>
