       <p class="col-sm-8">All my life, I have loved tweaking and messing with electronics more than anything else. Today, I am my family's very own computer technician because of all the skills I have acquired across the years.
       Make no mistake, it took years and many broken computers before I became competent enough to call myself a computer aficionado. Moving forward in my education, I am planning on specializing my education and learning the intricacies
       and details involving the function of computers and electronics, studying computer science and hardware manufacturing. I plan on attending my local city college for two years in order to save money and get general education out
       of the way, before transferring to a 4 year university and focusing in on my computer studies instead of a wide array of random classes. I hope to land myself a job at some sort of tech manufacturing company such as Nvidia or Intel,
       or maybe one day beginning a manufacturing business of my own. I believe that the tech industry, in its current state, could use more competition, especially in the form of processors and video card technologies, which I aim to solve.</p>
       
       <p>The reason I excel at learning and applying technological information is due to my quick learning ability. While my study and work habits are not amazing, those are things that are relatively easy to improve when applied to my rapid learning.
       I can teach myself anything I need to learn as long as I have the hardware to accomplish my end goals. As far as school goes, I pass my advanced classes and get very high scores on my important tests. On the SAT, I managed a score
       of 1460 without studying, and I have passed all my AP tests with an average score of a 4.</p>
       
       <p>Schooling aside, many friends and family have described me as honest, considerate, humorous, and very persuasive. I've done volunteer work for my local YMCA and participate in Youth & Government there too, which is a local program
       that encourages highschool age students to participate in government and teaches them the workings of government. I am also a member of my school Marching Band, for 4 years so far, this one being my last. One thing I learned from participating
       in these team or group related activities is how to work with people and compromising as well as working together to reach an end goal that is desirable for the most amount of people. This skill is easily one of the most important
       in accomplishing my goals, as I will meet many like-minded and amazing individuals who will be both amazing friends and great work partners moving forward.</p>
       
       <p>In conclusion, I have high hopes for not only my future, but the future of technology as well as humanity as a whole. Not only do I want to improve the technological sector, I plan on using all available assets to help make the
       planet both safer and cleaner for my and future generations, as our inheritance. I would love to thank you for reading this long description of my life, and would like to extend my hand for you to continue to follow my story and
       see where I end up. -Juan Marquez</p>
