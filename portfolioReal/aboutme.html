       Make no mistake, it took years and many broken computers before I became competent enough to call myself a computer aficionado. Moving forward in my education, I am planning on specializing my education and learning the intricacies
       and details involving the function of computers and electronics, studying computer science and hardware manufacturing. I plan on attending my local city college for two years in order to save money and get general education out

       or maybe one day beginning a manufacturing business of my own. I believe that the tech industry, in its current state, could use more competition, especially in the form of processors and video card technologies, which I aim to solve.</p>
