            <p class="text-center">My partner and I spent a while thinking about what would be a fun and interesting concept to have for a text adventure game. Eventually, we decided to have a fighting text adventure game because it most likely has not been done before, 
            or is certainly uncommon. One big part was coming up with the fighting system, which just uses if and elif statements to differentiate choices and change the stage in the game engine accordingly. Another big part was making sure the game wasn't 
            buggy at all. While both my partner and I worked heavily on the project and he wrote a lot of the combat scenarios present in the demo, I debugged most of the code and added the title and game over art, as well as proofread and assisted in 
            programming the mechanics of the game. Overall, it was a very fun and pleasant experience to work on, and to be able to make a humorous and entertaining game in the end was a great opportunity for me.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Story: </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center">After being disgraced by his “mama” for pursuing martial arts instead of a real career, Punctor Yengren sets out of his home in Finnmark to prove his worth to his mama by challenging and defeating fighters from every 
    realm of Yggdrasil and Valhalla, in order to become a god and pay the bills to prove to his mama his efforts are not for nothing. You go to the different realms of existence from Helheim to Asgard and challenge the strongest fighter in each 
    realm before finally facing Odin. Or, you get a regular job and that works too.</p>
